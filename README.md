Description of some files and folds

	1. Optical_recognition_Kfold_CV.py is used to train deep learning model
	2. The structure of model is shown in figure structure_optical_recognition_model.png
	3. The trained datasets are stored in fold datasets named X.npy and Y.npy
	4. The trained model is stored in fold models
	5. The performance of trainging processes are shown in images which are stored in fold performance_images
	6. load_model2recognize.py is used to load the trained model for recognizing
	7. The testing datasets are stored in fold datasets named X_test.npy and Y_test.npy


How to run program

	The program is coded in python, so when you want to run certain program, you can type as following:

	python scriptName.py

	in terminal. For example, if you want to run Optical_recognition_Kfold_CV.py, you should type:

	python Optical_recognition_Kfold_CV.py

	and press Enter
